## Back-End

## AI

### Model Architecture

Moodista employs MobileBERT, a lightweight version of the BERT model optimized for mobile devices, for text sentiment classification. We utilize MediaPipe Model Maker to customize the model, tailoring it to our specific data and applications.

### Dataset

The model is trained on emotion entries collected from the GoEmotions dataset, consisting of comments from Reddit users labeled with emotions like joy, sadness, fear, and anxiety. The dataset is preprocessed and formatted to suit the input requirements of the MobileBERT model.

### Deployment

The sentiment classification model is deployed on resource-constrained devices such as mobile phones or edge devices using TensorFlow Lite (TFLite) format, ensuring efficient execution with low latency and reduced memory footprint.

For more information on customizing models and datasets, refer to the [online documentation](https://developers.google.com/mediapipe/solutions/customization/text_classifier) and [Kaggle page](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/go-emotions-google-emotions-dataset).
